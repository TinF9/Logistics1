# Logistics 1

## Description

This is a logistics assistance project I developed for my brother. He is an engineer working for a logistics company.

He needed aid dealing with a large number of messy products. His target is to place each product into its correct destination according to the data he is provided about each one of them (product code, quantity and destination).

So what he needs is to take a messy product, to check for its code, and to have an easy and fast way to find it over the data so that he knows where to place it.

Finally, he wanted the program to count the already handled products, and to tell when a product is finished.

Only one library is integrated to handle data input from an `.xlsx` file. The rest of the script is Vanilla JavaScript.

## How to use it

1. You have to input the data you are going to be working with. This is done by selecting a proper `.xlsx` file. The file must contain the appropriate data with the **appropriate keys** for each product ("Product Code", "Quantity", "Placed", "Not Placed", "Destination List"). I have included an `.xlsx` file called `"InitialDataExcelExample.xlsx"` in the repository as an example that can be used to test the website.
2. The products and their values are arranged into a table for the user to have a comfortable view of them.
3. From the search box, you can select a product to work with and to see its values.
4. Use the buttons to count the products or to print the table.
